# @publici/create

This command line tool creates apps, graphics and other projects from templates for use by the Center for Public Integrity's data team. It sets things up real good so you don't have to worry about it none.

The current iteration is a lightweight wrapper around [SAO](https://v1.saojs.org/) that requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting started

```sh
npm init @publici <template> <name-of-project>
cd <name-of-project>
```
